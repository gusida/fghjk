    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>We retrieved the operational status of all NGO Search and Rescue Vessels working in the Central Mediterranean, for each month from January 2014 until December 2019. Sources include news reports, position data from <a target="_blank" href="www.marinetraffic.com">MarineTraffic</a>, reports from the <a target="_blank" href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2019/2019-update-ngos-sar-activities">European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights</a>, updates from the NGOs' own websites and social media posts. All NGOs mentioned were sent a copy of our data along with a request for verification.
    </p>
    <p>When authorities seized or impounded a vessel, it is marked as "seized" in the dataset for that month; if it was not seized for the entire month, the data entry will say "seized on XX" or "seized until", respectively. When authorities rendered impossible the operation of a vessel by other (legal) means, such as not granting a permission to sail or leave a port, the vessel is marked as "blocked" / "blocked since XX" / "blocked until" in our data set. If vessels paused their operations for reasons such as maintenance, fundraising etc during an entire month, it is marked as "paused".</p>
    <p>When we calculated the number of active vessels for a given month, only those that were operational during the entire month were counted. Those that were seized or blocked - even if only for part of that month - didn't count towards those numbers. Therefore, our data does not represent the maximum amount of vessels that could be found in the Central Mediterranean on the most frequented day in history; our data only represent those vessels for each month that were operational during the entire month.
